# CRUD Blog

Express-based CRUD blog to showcase server-side rendering with EJS templates. Implemented Mongoose to model and control Create, Edit, Update and Delete requests to MongoDB. Simple, pleasant UI thanks to Bootstrap 4 styles.

Haven't migrated the DB to a deployment platform as of yet - but here are some screenshots:
